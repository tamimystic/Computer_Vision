Deep Learning:
1. ANN- Artificial Neural Network
2. CNN- Convolutional Neural Network
3. Recurrent Neural Network


1.Here ANN is foundation, where we learn neural network, back propagation, loss function,
 activation function, optimizer. Most of the case we use it for Tabular data.

2. When we have grid data that means, image and video data then we use CNN.

3. When we time series data, that means un-structured data, that means text, audio we use RNN.
